Today I went to the Flughafen.
I was there to finally go on my yearly trip to Berlin.
I am so excited to try new Gebaeck, one im looking forward to is Apfelkuchen.
They also have lots of gebaeck as well!
First thing I have on my to-do list is to go to the Biergarten.
I get very wettbewerbsf√§hig when I go there.
It's right along the Hauptstrasse.
